# Maintained version of Tachyons CSS Version 5.

Tachyons 5 was originally designed and written by Adam Morse but received no updates for 2 years.
I discovered the branch on the Tachyons GitHub Repo and talked to Adam about getting it ready for release.
He was not entirely happy with it and not sure how to move on.

Original Dev Branch can be found here:
https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/tree/v5-final-final

Meanwhile I kept using and improving the dev version and fixed the errors and inconsistencies.

This fork is my current version of Tachyons 5 that is maintained by me and up-to-date.
Documentation will follow later on. 

Note that my version is maintained in pure CSS as is without a build step etc.
Goal is to have a zero-build-drop-in css utility framework at hand.

MIT License as original Tachyons.

Feel free to contact me about collaboration on this.

Cheers Bijan
